    <h1>Building Guide</h1>

    <p>This chapter covers the building process in more detail,
      describes the available building functions and provides
      tips for building in difficult conditions.</p>

    <a name="principles">
    <h2>Building Process Principles</h2>

    <p>When the building functions are used you will be dealing with
      two things called <b>buildplan</b> and <b>buildtask</b>.</p>

    <p>A buildplan is like a blueprint of a structure. It defines a
      list of blocks, including their meta values (which define
      subtype and/or orientation for some block types). The block
      coordinates within the buildplan are relative to a block at
      0,0,0 called <b>pivot</b>. The pivot block may be itself
      a part of the buildplan or not - it does not matter. The pivot
      however represents the &quot;origin&quot; of the buildplan</p>

    <p>A buildplan can be created using one of the parametric building
      functions, imported from external files, and manipulated in
      various ways.</p>

    <p>In order to start actual building, you need to start a buildtask
      from the buildplan by placing its pivot somewhere in the world.
      Both position and direction of the placement define how the
      blocks will be placed. The block coordinates are translated from
      the relative to the world coordinates. The orientation-dependent
      meta values are rotated to match the new direction. In the
      buildplan, the metas are encoded as if the pivot direction is
      towards north. When pivot is placed, you define the new direction.</p>

    <p>The actual placement may be done either by specifying explicit
      coordinates and direction as parameter, or more conveniently by
      placing a block. The coordinates and the direction of the placement
      are taken as pivot parameters, and the placement itself is not
      forwarded to the server.</p>

    <p>Some other parameters used in the various commands behave that
      way - you can either specify them explicitly, or omit them, and
      make MCBuild use some defaults derived from your current state.
      One such parameter is the material specification - if you omit it,
      MCBuild will just use the block type you are currently holding.
    </p>

    <p>In order to have a quick example, how it works, try following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hold some buildable block in your hand</li>
      <li>Enter <tt>#build floor 5,5</tt></li>
      <li>You should get a message about created floor</li>
      <li>Place any block at some coordinates</li>
      <li>You will receive another message about placing pivot and the building will start</li>
      <li>Walk around the structure being built to reach all corners</li>
      <li>Enter <tt>#build cancel</tt> to stop building</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/build_example.jpg">

    <p>You may have noticed that if you break the blocks you just
      built without canceling, they will be immediately rebuilt. This is
      because your active buildtask constantly checks if there are
      buildable blocks in vicinity that are unoccupied and will attempt
      to place blocks there.</p>

    <p>In order to be built, blocks need to have adjacent blocks already
      in place. Most full blocks without specific orientation can be placed
      on any of the adjacent surfaces, but certain blocks require a certain
      direction to be placed in order to obtain correct orientation. Ultimately,
      the player must click once of the suitable points at a suitable face
      while facing a suitable direction.</p>

    <p>While a buildtask is active, MCBuild constantly checks which blocks
      fulfill these conditions and can be placed, but it is the task of the
      player to navigate around the structure to reach all possible points</p>

    <p>MCBuild will automatically fetch the necessary materials from your
      inventory into the hotbar slots 3-7 and use them to build. If you're
      building in creative mode, that works as well, but you need to have all
      materials you are using in your survival inventory - creative block
      selection is not supported.</p>

    <a name="parameters">
    <h2>Build Command Parameters</h2>

    <p>Before we can review the various build commands available, we need
      to understand how MCBuild is parsing parameters to its functions.
      The parameter parsing is designed such way that the user will have
      to type as little as possible while avoiding ambiguity. Many option
      names can be shortened or omitted, some parameter parts have default
      values, and as already mentioned, some parameters can be omitted
      altogether, making MCBuild using suitable defaults derived from your
      current gamestate.</p>

    <p>There are two types of parameters - named parameters and flags.</p>

    <p>The flag-type parameters are always preceeded by a minus sign, but
      may have long or short name. They are simple switches, enabling
      some option when specified.</p>

    <p>Named parameters have the general format <tt>name=value</tt>.
      If a command expects a certain named parameter, if will first
      look for the general form, using the full or one of the shortened
      names of the parameter. If not found, a named parameter may have
      a default position, in which case the name can be omitted, and only
      the value used as parameter. If that is not found, or the parameter
      has no default position, it may have a way to be derived from
      the game state. For example, the parameter defining a position of
      the pivot can be obtained when player places a block.</p>

    <p>Named parameters in their full form (i.e. with the name), and flags
      can be specified in any order on the command line. Named parameters
      without a name however must be specified in their default order.</p>

    <p>The values of the named parameter may have many different forms.
      So, for example a material specification can be done by numeric
      block ID, or hexadecimal ID, or even by name. It may also have an
      optional meta value, which can be also numeric or a string.</p>

    <p>The following example illustrates how it works for the command
      <tt>#build stair</tt>. This command creates a flight of stairs,
      it has a mandatory parameter <tt>size</tt> and optional parameter
      the <tt>material</tt>, as well as a few flags. The following
      list shows examples what the user can specify and how MCBuild
      will interpret this.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs size=5,20 material=brick</tt></p>
    <p>This creates a buildplan of stairs, 5 blocks wide, and 10 blocks
      high, made of brick blocks and the default minimal base -
      one column of blocks under the stairs to provide connection
      between the steps).</p>

    <img src="images/stairs1.jpg">
    
    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs m=brick s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This will create exactly the same, but the order of the parameters
      is arbitrary (since they both have proper names) and I used
      the short names.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs 5,10 brick</tt></p>
    <p>This is an even shorter form that omits the names and therefore
      the parameters are interpreted in their default order. It is
      assumed that &quot;5,10&quot; is the size parameter, and
      &quot;brick&quot; is the material.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs brick 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This however will give you an error - the parameters have no names
      so the default order is assumed, and &quot;brick&quot; cannot
      be parsed as size.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs m=brick 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This however works - the material parameter is identified by the
      explicit name, while the size as the first unnamed parameter</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs brick s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>This works as well - as long as the ambiguity is resolved
      somehow, argument parsing will identify the necessary parameters.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs -e wooden_stairs -f s=5,10</tt></p>
    <p>Flags can be placed anywhere - since they have a unique name
      and can be identified by the minus sign. This particular command
      will use wooden stairs block, make a full base (i.e. base extends
      over the entire width of the stairs) and make sure exactly same block
      is used for the base (otherwise MCBuild will try to use matching
      wooden planks)</p>

    <img src="images/stairs2.jpg">

    <hr>
    <p><tt>#build stairs 5,10</tt></p>
    <p>In this case we don't specify the material. MCBuild will assume
      we want to build using the block we currently hold in our hand.
      If the player holds nothing, or it's an item that cannot be placed
      as a block, you will receive an error.</p>

    <img src="images/stairs3.jpg">
    <p>As you may see - in this case the cobblestone stairs was
      used for building the stairs, since the player held it in hand
      and the cobblestone block was used for the base.</p>

    <h2>Common Parameter</h2>

    <p>A reference for some common parameter value formats used in multiple
      commands.</p>

    <a name="par_mat">
    <h3>Material</h3>

    <p>Material can be specified my its decimal or hexadecimal block ID,
      or by symbolic name. For slabs you can also specify whether you
      want the upper or the lower form.</p>

    <p>Names: material,mat,m</p>

    <p>As example, the following material formats represent stone and sandstone
      slabs in different positions. The block ID for stone slabs is 0x2C / 44, but
      block meta is additionally required to define exact material and position.
      By default, meta=0 will be assumed, which corresponds to the plain stone slabs
      in lower position. Sandstone stone slabs have meta 1 for the lower (default)
      and 9 for the upper position. The exact type can be controlled by the explicit
      meta value or in combination of the meta value + upper flag</p>

    <a name="par_pivot">
    <h3>Pivot</h3>

    <p>The pivot parameter defines a specific absolute world coordinates plus
      direction. As the name suggests, it defines the exact placement of a pivot
      block in the world and is thus used with commands lice <tt>place</tt> and
      <tt>scan</tt></p>

    <p>Names: pivot,pv,p,from,pos,at</p>

    <p>Default: waits for the player to place a block and uses these coordinates and
      direction (place command only)</p>

    <p>Default pivot: depending on the command. For 'build place', pivot can be specified
      by placing a block after a command was issued</p>
