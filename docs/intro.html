    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>MCBuild is a custom client for Minecraft with a lot of additional
      functions but it's primary emphasis is auto-building. It is capable
      of building in creative or survival mode, and will work on servers
      with Anti-cheat, however due to its nature, it will work in multiplayer
      only. If you want to use it in a single-player game, you nevertheless
      can run your own server locally and load it with your SP world, or
      access a single-player game shared by another user on the network.</p>

    <p>Unlike many custom/hacked clients available around, mcbuild uses
      a completely different approach. It is not quite correct to call
      it a client at all - instead it's a proxy-like application that
      sits between your client and the server you play on and manipulates
      Minecraft protocol only. It passes most Minecraft traffic transparently,
      while inserting, dropping or modifying some packets as needed.</p>

    <p>This has both advantages and drawbacks. On one hand you don't
      need to give up on your favorite client or apply any mods to it
      - you can continue using it as is. If you have a hacked client
      or mods you use, the functions from mcbuild will add to them,
      not replace them. On the other hand, mcbuild lacks the possibility
      to add any GUI elements on your client and the only way to control
      it or receive information from it is via minecraft protocol. Most
      commands and notifications happen through the chat, and a few by
      means of spawning phantom blocks or entities. Consider it like
      this - mcbuild is a CLI, not a GUI application and it will take
      some ambition to learn to use it, but I hope you will appreciate
      its potential.</p>

    <a name="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>MCBuild started back in 2012 as "minemap" - a mere mapping tool for
      Minecraft. Initially tested for the Anvil map data generated in the
      single play, I wanted to extend it to the multiplayer games as well
      and started reading on the Minecraft protocol. At that time,
      Minecraft 1.2 was the current version and I figured out, the map
      data could be simply extracted from the network traffic - I just
      needed to record my gaming session with Wireshark and extract necessary
      messages from the PCAP.</p>

    <p>But starting with the version 1.3, Minecraft intrroduced protocol
      encryption and the capturing method could be no longer used. So, I
      came with the idea of "mcproxy" - a transparent proxy for the Minecraft
      protocol, that would hook into encrypted connection between the client
      and the server by using the man-in-the-middle (MITM) principle. The
      standard Minecraft client would connect to the proxy, and the proxy
      would connect to the remote server, passing all traffic transparently.
      Since the proxy process establishes the encryption session on both sides,
      it will have access to the plaintext traffic. I quickly realized
      that this setup has more potential than just passively mapping stuff.</p>

    <p>At that time I joined the infamous 2b2t.net server (before it became
      .org). I'm still an active player there and most of the functions
      developed for MCBuild related to my experience on that server. Even
      the default server to connect to is 2b2t. The most famous feature
      of that server is that the map was never reset, and survived through
      all generations of Minecraft starting from the Alpha times at the spawn,
      this, and also a huge number of players that went through the server,
      combined with the absolute anarchy and massive use of hacked clients
      has left the spawn area resembling a nuclear explosion site.
      Even many miles across, the players managed to wreck the world beyond
      recognition.</p>

    <p>The first problem every newbie player like myself was facing is escaping
      the spawn and finding any wood, essential to basic survival. The first
      tree I found was over 1.5km away from my spawn point - everything closer
      was ripped out or burned by the endless herds of players. But the next
      step was a bit trickier - as I wanted to set up my first enchanting table,
      I could not find any sugarcane many miles around to make my books. This
      is where I started extending the functionality with a simple function to
      search for certain blocks. I could find whole 3 blocks of sugarcane in the
      4 km radius from spawn - by some terrain generator glitch they landed deep
      underwater and so survived the greedy players.</p>

    <p>Later I started extending the functionality with various hacking
      functions like self-made Killaura, player notification, entity finder,
      etc. Then, in 2014 came the idea to implement the auto-building. I
      completely redesigned the mcproxy from scratch and started implementing
      first auto-building features. The development was a bit delayed by the
      switch to a new Minecraft protocol which came with 1.6.6 and a complete
      redesign of the framework to cope with the increased complexity of the
      code.</p>

    <p>The development progressed slowly, but culminated in April/May 2015, as I
      participated in the April Fools and then in the Third Spawn Incursion,
      the yearly events semi-spontaneously happening on 2b2t. In the April Fools
      event I already had a somewhat reliably working implementation which I
      used to build a crude castle in the Cactus Republic base.</p>

    <p>After the April Fools event, I went on more implementing and testing
      in the harsh conditions of 2b2t and started building a secret "Rocket
      Valley", with its first exhibits - a full size Saturn V and Space
      Shuttle replicas (models courtesy
      <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/saturn-v-to-scale-schematic/">Eocen</a> and
      <a href="http://www.planetminecraft.com/project/space-shuttle-on-launchpad/">DNV970</a>
      at PlanetMinecraft)</p>

    <p>Finally, in May 2015 I participated in the Third Spawn Incursion event.
      At that point, MCBuild gathered a lot of new features, fixes and
      special building modes making building more efficient and safe in survival,
      anti-cheat and exceptionally laggy environment of 2b2t. The event
      culminated with the erection of the Wrath Outpost (aka SIB - Spawn
      Incursion Base) an enormous obsidian structure for which I built the
      most of the great arches,the curved entrace roof and the dome, as
      well as some minor elements.</p>

    <p>Another prominent building sitting right next to Wrath Outpost was
      my Melon Castle - a castle built completely out of ~8000 melon blocks.
      Although it was destroyed at least 4 times during the Incursion,
      I was able to quickly rebuild it. The last version was still
      standing 2 months later - heavily nibbled upon by the hungry spawn escapees.</p>

    <p>Later in the Summer 2015, I used MCBuild to build some of the
      structures in the King's Landing base. All these events provided
      a huge amount of experience that helped me eliminate more bugs,
      extend functionality and make improvements into building process.
      Finally the development came to the stage where I could release it
      as a more-or-less feature complete, stable and documented version
      to the general public. Please enjoy using it, bug reports and
      suggestions for improvements are welcome!</p>
