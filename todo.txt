= general organization =

+ make a buildplan a separate struct
* manage multiple buildplans instead of one global
+ move functions to create and manipulate buildplans to a separate module w/o any access to the global data or gamestate
- introduce asynchronous packet queue

= meta manipulations =

- support more meta-oriented blocks
- meta value mapping for rotation (for all blocks)
+ meta value mapping when flipping
* meta value mapping when tilting (only y-tilting, i.e. rotation is supported)
+ find a base material from stairs/slab etc. blocks
- replace should correctly handle material replacement for orientation-dependent blocks

= build process =

+ placement of double-slabs
- add delay between single slab placements to avoid accidental double-slab placement
- better way to handle block repeated placements
  - verify if the block placement is confirmed
- option to place blocks with less restrictions (e.g. for creative mode and w/o NoCheat)
  - no turning to target
  - extended reach
  - no need for supporting blocks
* support placement for blocks that have a differing item ID in the inventory, e.g. doors, cauldrons

= buildplan manipulation =

- auto-supports for disconnected blocks
+ export to schematic
+ fix trim issue - does not handle x/z correctly
+ hollow-2D

= inventory handling =

+ fix inventory transfers for lava/water buckets (could not find any issue with buckets, but fixed other 2 bugs in the process)
+ fix inventory transfers for named blocks
- handle failed transactions
- autojunk/autostorage
- proper handling of conditionally-stackable items, e.g. Written Books

= in-world preview =

- better preview/phantom block framework
- optimize build preview for large builds
- fix removal of the preview (maybe - refresh world by sending chunks)
- mask/selection with preview
- mask from the buildplan/buildtask

= other functions =

- map marker (using a beacon beam for example)
- turn to target when attacking
- import PNG for pixel art, or convert to bplan with an external tool
  - allow for different block sets
- autowalking to specific coordinates
- autoenchant
- search for blocks
- safewalking
- mcp replay
- mapper
- tunnel detection
- autocrafting

= arguments parsing =

+ option parsing
+ materials by name in #replace

= parametric builds =

+ better ring/circle algorithm
- ellipse, ellipsoid
- spiral
- checkerboard
- arch
- generic radial pattern (i.e. spiral-like)
- generic orthogonal pattern (e.g. parabola)
- cone
