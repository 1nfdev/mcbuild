= meta manipulations =

- support more meta-oriented blocks
- meta value rotation (was this completed?)
- meta value flipping
- meta value tilting
- orientation-meta mapping in #replace
- find a base material from stairs/slab etc. blocks

= build process =

- placement of double-slabs
- add delay between single slab placements to avoid accidental double-slab placement
- better way to handle block repeated placements
  - verify if the block placement is confirmed
- option to place blocks with less restrictions (e.g. for creative mode and w/o NoCheat)
  - no turning to target
  - extended reach
  - no need for supporting blocks
- auto-supports for disconnected blocks

= inventory handling =

- fix inventory transfers for lava/water buckets
- fix inventory transfers for the named blocks
- handle failed transactions
- autojunk/autostorage

= in-world preview =

- optimize build preview for large builds
- fix removal of the preview (maybe - refresh world by sending chunks)
- mask/selection with preview

= other functions =

- map marker (using a beacon beam for example)
- export to schematic
- turn to target when attacking
- import PNG for pixel art, or convert to bplan with an external tool
  - allow for different block sets
- autowalking to specific coordinates
- autoenchant
- search for blocks
- safewalking
- mcp replay
- mapper
- tunnel detection
- autocrafting

= arguments parsing =

- option parsing
- materials by name in #replace

= parametric builds =

- better ring/circle algorithm, ellipse, ellipsoid
- spiral
- checkerboard
- arch
- generic radial pattern (i.e. spiral-like)
- generic orthogonal pattern (e.g. parabola)
